# Birthday Invite Project

A basic HTML project where I created a birthday invitation webpage using only HTML. This project helped me practice fundamental tags like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. It demonstrates simple webpage structure and element formatting.

## 🛠️ What I Learned
- How to use `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings.
- Creating bullet lists using `<ul>` and `<li>`.
- Adding images with `<img>`.
- Inserting hyperlinks using `<a>` tags.
- Using `<p>` for paragraphs and organizing content.
